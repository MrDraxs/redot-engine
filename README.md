## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Redot Engine](---) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](---), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](---).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Redot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](---).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.

Before being forked in [Set 2024](---),
Redot was being developed by the Godot Foundation and before that when it was closed source it was being developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
